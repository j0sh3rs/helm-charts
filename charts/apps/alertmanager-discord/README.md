## Dependencies

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add j0sh3rs https://j0sh3rs.github.io.com/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install alertmanager-discord j0sh3rs/alertmanager-discord
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `alertmanager-discord`

```console
helm install alertmanager-discord j0sh3rs/alertmanager-discord
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `alertmanager-discord` deployment

```console

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/j0sh3rs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/library/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/j0sh3rs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/library/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install alertmanager-discord \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
    j0sh3rs/alertmanager-discord
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install alertmanager-discord j0sh3rs/alertmanager-discord -f values.yaml
```
